Human free-hand sketches provide a useful data source for facilitating visual analogy. Although there has been research on the roles of sketching and the impact of visual analogy in design, little work has been done aiming to develop computational tools and methods to support visual analogy from sketches. In this paper, we propose a computational method to discover visual similarity between sketches, considering the following practical application: Given a sketch drawn by a designer that reflects the designer’s rough idea in mind, our goal is to identify the shape similar sketches that can stimulate the designer to make more and better visual analogies. The first challenge in doing so is how to discover the similar shape features embedded in sketches from various categories. To address this challenge, we propose a deep clustering model to learn a latent space which can reveal underlying shape features for multiple categories of sketches and cluster sketches simultaneously. An extensive evaluation of the clustering performance of our proposed method has been carried out in different configurations. The results have shown that the proposed method can discover sketches that have similar appearance, provide useful explanations of the visual relationship between different sketch categories, and has the potential to generate visual stimuli to enhance designers’ visual imageries.","tags":["Deep learning","Visual Analogy","Computer Vision","Sketching"],"title":"An Unsupervised Deep Learning Model to Discover Visual Similarity Between Sketches for Visual Analogy Support","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zi-jian Zhang","Lin Gong","Yan Jin","Jian Xie","Jia Hao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598159670,"objectID":"42817a7cdaec06c7912f23e07269f2b4","permalink":"https://jameyimpact.github.io/publication/zhang-201752/","publishdate":"2020-08-23T05:14:30.747271Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zhang-201752/","section":"publication","summary":"Design alternative evaluation in the early stages of engineering design plays an important role in determining the success of new product development, as it influences considerably the subsequent design activities. However, existing approaches to design alternative evaluation are overly reliant on experts’ ambiguous and subjective judgments and qualitative descriptions. To reduce subjectivity and improve efficiency of the evaluation process, this paper proposes a quantitative evaluation approach through data-driven performance predictions. In this approach, the weights of performance characteristics are determined based on quantitative assessment of expert judgments, and the ranking of design alternatives is achieved by predicting performance values based on historical product design data. The experts’ subjective and often vague judgments are captured quantitatively through a rough number based Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. In order to facilitate performance based quantitative ranking of alternatives at the early stages of design where no performance calculation is possible, a particle swarm optimization based support vector machine (PSO-SVM) is applied for historical data based performance prediction. The final ranking of alternatives given the predicted values of multiple performance characteristics is achieved through Višekriterijumska Optimizacija I kompromisno Rešenje (VIKOR). A case study is carried out to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.","tags":["Design Alternative Evaluation","Quantitative Evaluation","Data-driven","Performance Prediction"],"title":"A quantitative approach to design alternative evaluation based on data-driven performance prediction","type":"publication"}]
